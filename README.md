# KaPay

A Kaspa wallet for Android, from the makers of KaChat.

- **Portfolio** - your balance, its value, price and network charts, and every transaction
- **Cold Storage** - watch and spend funds held on an air-gapped KasSigner device (signing happens on the device, by QR)
- **Wallet** - receive, send, request payment, your addresses, your domains, and the Address Book
  (saved Kaspa addresses with names)
- **.kachat** - the .kachat names marketplace: find, claim, buy and sell names
- **Settings** - appearance, security, connection, notifications, storage, and a backup of the
  Address Book and Portfolio to your own Nextcloud if you connect one

KaPay (formerly KaChat Wallet) is the Android counterpart of the iPhone's KaPay. It started from
KaChat's own wallet code ([KaChat-Android](https://github.com/KaspaSilver/KaChat-Android)) so KaChat
can focus on chats.

## For the server

What KaPay needs from the KaChat server is handed off in the server's own repo,
[KaChat-Indexer](https://github.com/KaspaSilver/KaChat-Indexer), under `docs/`. The push contract the
app follows is [PUSH_SERVICE.md](PUSH_SERVICE.md).
