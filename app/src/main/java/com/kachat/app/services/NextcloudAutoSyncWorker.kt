/**
 * Periodic fallback for Automatic Backup of the Address Book and the Portfolio (see
 * [NextcloudSyncService]) — every 6 hours, network connected + battery not low, its own unique
 * work, enqueued only while an account is connected with Automatic Backup on. The upload a few
 * seconds after a change, and the one on going to the background, are the primary paths; this
 * worker only exists so a backup the process died before finishing (the persisted owed flag still
 * set) eventually lands. When nothing is owed it does no network work at all.
 *
 * Always reports success: a failed attempt leaves the backup owed, and the next 6-hour cycle (or
 * the next change, background or launch) retries — WorkManager's own backoff/retry machinery
 * would only duplicate that.
