/**
 * "Received" notifications: alerts the user when any of the wallet's own addresses - the main
 * address, spending-chain addresses (Manage Addresses) or watch-only cold-storage addresses -
 * receives Kaspa from someone else. Android port of iOS's `AddressActivityNotifier.swift`.
 *
 * As on iOS, two paths: the live one - [OwnAddressSubscription] streams the node's UTXO changes
 * for the wallet's own addresses into [handleLiveUtxoChanges] - and a catch-up diff for what
 * arrived while there was no stream: a per-wallet BASELINE + DIFF on app-foreground
 * ([onAppForeground]), when the subscription comes (back) up, from the periodic background worker
 * ([runPassNow]), and on a fallback poll ([POLL_INTERVAL_MS]) only while the subscription is down:
 *
 * - Per-wallet balance baselines persist across launches; the first run for a wallet (or a new
 *   address) seeds them silently and sets the address's floor - no dredging up history.
 * - A balance increase is attributed to the address's recent transactions newer than its floor,
 *   newest first, up to the increase. A tx with ANY input spending from one of our addresses is
 *   our own (change, consolidation, a send from another app on the same seed) and never
 *   notifies; an input the REST API hasn't resolved yet is looked up in the tx that created it
 *   ([spendsOwnFunds]). Unattributable increases notify a neutral "Balance increased".
 * - With remote push registered, the push service sends "Received" for the same addresses and the
 *   open app hides it - so the app announces a receive itself only while it is open, and one that
 *   landed while it was away is left to the push ([pushShowsReceive]).
 * - Handled txIds are persisted per wallet (cap 500) so passes never double-notify.
 * - [utxoActivityEvents] ALWAYS emits when watched balances change - a UI-refresh signal
 *   (Available pill, Manage Addresses, Cold Storage) NOT gated by the Address Activity setting.
 * - The notification itself is gated by Settings > Notifications > "Address Activity" (default
 *   ON) plus the global notifications toggle.
