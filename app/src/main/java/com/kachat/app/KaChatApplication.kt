/**
 * Application class — required by Hilt for dependency injection.
 * All singleton services are initialized here via Hilt modules in the `di` package.
 *
 * Startup rule: nothing optional may stop the app from opening. A Play build 5.2 would not open
 * on a GrapheneOS phone (no crash log): 5.2 built more services eagerly, and on a hardened ROM
 * the Keystore behind EncryptedSharedPreferences can throw. So every service below is injected
 * as [dagger.Lazy] - Hilt's field injection (inside super.onCreate) creates none of them - and
 * onCreate then builds each one as its own [startupStep], in the same order as before: one that
 * throws is logged and the app opens without it. (The portfolio is built just after, off the main
 * thread.) The lifecycle callbacks below are guarded the same way. [hiltWorkerFactory] is the one
 * plain field (WorkManager's configuration needs it, and it is built from the graph alone).
